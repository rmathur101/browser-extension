# Repo Overview
The repo has two main folders: api (backend code) and client (frontend code). For the backend, we plan to use python. For the frontend, undecided if any frameworks will be used - still understanding the browser extensions ecosystem. Browsers have different standards, and different degrees to which they implement the w3c browser extensions standard (annoying!), so still exploring this.

# Running the Extension 
1. In the meantime, if you want to test out the (very basic) functionality on Chrome, do the following:

2. In the above step, after clicking "Load unpacked" and being prompted to select the "extension directory", choose the "client" folder from this repo (this is where the extension code lives).


3. After this step, you should either see a new icon on your extensions toolbar, or you should see it in the dropdown after clicking the "Extensions" icon. The extension is called "Example". You can pin in to your toolbar if you wish. The icon for the extension should look something like this:

4. Clicking the extension should give you something that looks like this:

5. And that's it for now! Much more to do. If you have any issues, please make sure you're running the latest version of Chrome (I'm using manifest v3 on Chrome which is new-ish). Or else, feel free to contact me (email: rmathur101@gmail.com)!
